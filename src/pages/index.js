                  <b>A little about my personal mission:</b> <br />
                  Currently, I am driven by the mission of changing the world's
                  relationship with money & commerce. Specifically, I am
                  inspired by companies like{" "}
                  <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/fe4a0bd4-5c58-4208-b5e4-e3a2d42c7d7a/bKash+Case.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=mGp39sL">
                    bKash
                  </a>
                  whose payment infrastructure has given power to the
                  underprivileged & underbanked in Bangladesh;{" "}
                  <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a> who are helping the
                  underbanked get access to fantastic financial systems and also
                  my past employer - <a href="www.shopify.com">Shopify</a>, who
                  have empowered small merchants by giving them access to
                  capital and commerce infrastructure. <br />
                  <br />
                  Understandbly so, I'm also extremely bullish on Cryptocurrency
                  (specifically Bitcoin â‚¿) and the impact it will have on the
                  underbanked. <br />
                  <br /> TL;DR: I believe a combination of deep tech (like
                  advances in Machine Learning, Distributed & Cloud computing),
                  good product sense and with inclusive UX design we can really
                  shape and transform our relationship with money & business.
