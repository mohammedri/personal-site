I"t<p>Hello -</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a Product Manager with a technical &amp; design background focusing building platforms &amp; products for customers.</p>

<p>The verticals I am most familiar with are e-commerce, developer/data science/analytics platforms, payment systems, emerging markets &amp; alternative banks.</p>

<p>My primary focus is the intersection of deep Learning, product development &amp; monetization strategies.</p>

<p>Currently I work at <a href="www.dessa.com">@Dessa</a> - a Deep Learning startup behind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWK_iYBl8cA">this wild Joe Rogan DeepFake</a> amongst other Machine Learning projects. As of 2020, we have been acquired by Square - where we use applied deep learning to help build products for our customers.</p>

<p>Prior to Dessa, I spent a few years building data platforms <a href="www.shopify.com">@Shopify</a>.</p>
