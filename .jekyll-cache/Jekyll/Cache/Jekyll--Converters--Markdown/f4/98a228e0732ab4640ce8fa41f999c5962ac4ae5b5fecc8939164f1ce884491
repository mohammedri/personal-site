I"&<p>This is a technique that I used to practice during my time at University - but was also discussed by <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is simple: everyday schedule time for yourself where you are able to freely do whatever you want: mindlessly browse the internet if you need to, play the guitar if you need to.</p>

<p>Your objective is during your “work time” you are fully focused on working. The goal is to generate a rhythm similar to the pomodoro technique but on a macro level.</p>
