I"<p>Action is harder but better than reading, it is very easy to fall into the trap of constantly trying to just read and not do anything about all the knowledge you read.</p>

<p>In our day and age it is very easy to be an info-vore and not actually do anything with the knowledge you gain. We are always looking at improving ourselves through #productivity-hacks and learning about #self-development. But very rarely will these concepts stick with you, if they arenâ€™t read at the right time and actioned upon.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of consuming mindfully, but producing rapidly. Be selective about what you read &amp; eat - but freely create things or expend energy in any way possible.</p>
