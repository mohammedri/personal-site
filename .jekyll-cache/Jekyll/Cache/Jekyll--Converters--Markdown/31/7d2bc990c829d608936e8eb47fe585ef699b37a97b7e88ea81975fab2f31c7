I"Æ<p>This sounds silly now and I am almost ashamed to say how much of a terrible time I have always had remembering what constitutes true positives, true negatives, false positives &amp; false negatives.</p>

<p>To this day - I will slip occassionally but much lesser so now then before!</p>

<p>Here is the silly way it finally worked and clicked for me:</p>

<p>True positives == these are actually true AND have been selected by the model. <strong>Yay, found a good one!</strong></p>

<p>True negative == these are actually wrong and have been classified as wrong by the model.  <strong>Nothing here, really!</strong></p>

<p>False Negatives == these are actually correct but have been classified as wrong by the model. <strong>Missed a good one, so sorry!</strong></p>

<p>False Positive == these are actually wrong but have been classified as correct by the model.  <strong>Oops, false alarm, sorry!</strong>.</p>

<p>This diagram from Wikimedia also really helped click &amp; remember this concept. I am a visual learner, as such the picture is often stuck in my head.</p>
