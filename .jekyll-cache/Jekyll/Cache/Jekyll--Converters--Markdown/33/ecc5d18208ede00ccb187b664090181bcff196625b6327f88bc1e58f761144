I"ê<p>Excited to share that, my team just recently open sourced Atlas.</p>

<p>Atlas is a flexible Machine Learning platform that consists of a Python SDK, CLI, GUI &amp; Scheduler to help Machine Learning Engineering teams dramatically reduce the model development time &amp; reduce effort in managing infrastructure.</p>

<p>We are still currently in BETA and would love the community‚Äôs help to ship a flexible, easy to use - ML Platform.</p>

<p><strong>Check out and contribute to Atlas in our Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/dessa-oss/atlas">https://github.com/dessa-oss/atlas</a></strong></p>
