            <p>Scattered / random thoughts: </p>
              <li>
                  <ul> When championing an experimental projects that is of high visibility there are several things to watch out for.
                      The first being who you are taking on as stakeholders. It is extremely important that whoever you take on as
                      stakeholder has a clearly defined and strong sense of understanding on how they are contributing to a project.
                      Often times we can get lost in the glamour assosciated with a project, attracting a lot of unnecessary attention
                      that can only slow down people's productivity. While you can account for number of hours being spent on a project
                      and equate that with business needs by doing simple calculations on $$$ spent vs. potential of profit, it is much
                      more difficult to account for the time wasted in context switching and time spent when the number of communication
                      channels are too many. All of these issues are highly likely when a project has too many people. 
                  </ul>
