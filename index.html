                I design and build products for Engineers - my approach is to apply the same degree of design thinking to technical products as we do with consumer products. 
                A product, regardless of how technical the audience needs to have strong utility and be delightful to use.
                I switch between engineering and business/product strategy often.

            <h2>Scattered / random thoughts: </h2>
            <h3>On experimental projects</h3>
            <p>
            <span class="newthought">When championing experimental projects</span> that are of high visibility there are several things to watch out for.
              The first being who you are taking on as stakeholders. It is extremely important that whoever you take on as
              stakeholder has a clearly defined and strong sense of understanding on how they are contributing to a project.
              Often times we can get lost in the glamour assosciated with a project, attracting a lot of unnecessary attention
              that can only slow down people's productivity. This pretty much applies to life in general, while recognition and glamour
              are attractive, they do nothing but give us instant gratification and slow down the process of learning and doing.
              Recognition as a means of feedback however is a wonderful way to increase someones confidence and productivity.
              <br>
              In a project you can account for number of hours being spent on it and equate that with business needs by doing simple calculations on $$$ spent vs. potential of profit, it is much
              more difficult to account for the time wasted in context switching and time spent when the number of communication
              channels are too many. All of these issues are highly likely when a project has too many people.
              <br>
              <em>Note: While, I am not a big proponent of micro-management and excruciatingly
                noting down hours spent on something, I still think a small estimation as a guiding light is important at the beginning of a project.</em>
