I often see early-stage PMs mess up their MVP / Alpha strategy. They create wonderful landing pages, add pricing and hope to get the first 10-100 customers through the door. There is a strong fixation on attempting to get customers. In truth, I believe MVPs and alpha versions are created to LEARN not to EARN. Always prioritize the features that will help us learn the fastest and help test our hypothesis towards finding product market fit. Don't worry about earning / monetization or closing the deal at this stage.

Take the top of funnel and all your new customers and really dig into why they chose your MVP, use your MVP to constantly validate that you are solving the right problems.

Too many startups worry too about closing a deal too early on, this sub optimal approach is problematic as it doesn't ensure long term product market fit.
