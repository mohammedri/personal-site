# Various ways the human brain is different from computers

- The human brain is different from a computer in that there is no centralized CPU or memory locations. Instead the network’s knowledge and memories are distributed throughout the structure in the “weights” of it.
- Feedback loops form the crux of the brain as well. Whereas in computers often it is usually sensors —> CPU —> Action.

For example in the circuit between the Neocortex and the Thalamus, connections going backwards towards the brain exceeds connections going forwards.

This could be a good indicator that #reinforcement-learning could be a step towards #artificial-general-intelligence

One could argue that back propagation can account for this. But this is not particularly true - because #back-propagation only usually happens during the training time. It doesn't actually happen during the inference time at all.
