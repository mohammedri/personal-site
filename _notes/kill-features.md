title: Kill features that don't work, FAST.
---

Slashing & burning features / products is a skill and it is something that you have to constantly be mindful of and practice actively.

When working on a feature in a bigger company - the team can usually fall in love with their feature and may never actually think about the value / disvalue it brings to the overall product.

They may be so busy tweaking and optimizing for the feature to succeed & increase their acquisition or engagement for that feature that they may fail to realize that the overall product is getting lesser and lesser in value.

It is difficult to kill the things you love, but if not done soon enough features grow like weeds and suck the energy out which could have been used elsewhere.

It is the PMâ€™s job to be able to kill something when it is no longer providing strategic value.
