title: Dealing with conflicting priorities on projects that have multiple dependencies on other projects
---

There are many times when you will be working on a project which is dependent on the completion of a different project handled by a different team (let’s call them team B).

Team B, might actually be serving multiple other stakeholders and you may be just one of them. This typically occurs with teams that are part of a service line group. In most companies teams within service lines, support multiple product teams and your team may be just 1/N of the teams they serve.

Team B may support product line team P1 and your product team P2.

Suppose P1 and P2 both need different features from team B to accomplish their strategic objectives, how does team B prioritize?

One line of thinking is that there can never be a situation where 2 strategic directions are weighted equally, I don't buy that. From my experience, there has been multiple situations where this is likely.

TL;DR: the answer is communication and higher level business strategy decisions with executives.

## Data driven communication & transparency is key to solving such issues

To solve such issues, I have found the following method to be effective.

The PMs on team P1 and P2 must do the following:

1. Communicate which is the most impactful work they see to be on their radar that they want done to move their OWN goals (both PMs must be be extremely selfish in this step and write this down as a best case scenario).
2. Find out which other teams and which other initiatives conflict with this initiative.
3. Write down precisely what signals you are using to form your opinion? And what signals are they (the other team) is using to form their opinion?
   1. e.g. \$1m of lost deals due to lack of feature X, 50% respondents asking feature Y etc and translate these into expected business outcomes.
4. Share this with company leadership.
5. With this leadership needs to reprioritize each teams’ direction.
6. Hopefully this happens every 6 weeks (because 6 week cadence is great to get shit done, more on this later) and ideally it doesn’t change the course of action of teams between those 6 weeks.
