# Personal website
This is a simple basic website that will display links to my various internet profiles.

# Styling
The bulk of the styling is based on Edward Tufte's works. I find it quite appealing to read in such a style with a light beige background. Really gives the reading-a-book feel. I highly recommend it for anyone. You can read more about it here: https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/

# TODO
[ ] Tweet style 180 character breakdown chunk of reading blog posts.
[ ] Build a static site generator to simply addition of blog posts in markdown in Ruby / GO.
