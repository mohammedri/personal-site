# Hi -

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  <img src="../assets/data.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:left;width:100px;height:100px; padding-right:18px;object-fit: cover;">
  I'm Mohammed, a Product Manager working on Deep Learning Products <a href="www.dessa.com">@Dessa</a> (acquired by <a href="www.squareup.com">@Square</a>). <br />You can learn more about me <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="/about">here.</a></span>.
  <br /><br />
  Or you can reach out to me on <b><a href="https://www.twitter.com/mohammedri_">Twitter</a></b> (DMs open, say hi!).
</p>

_This website serves a few purposes:_

- I maintain most of my long form writings here; short form thoughts are usually on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mohammedri_).
- This is my JavaScript/Web development playground
- It also holds several incomplete thoughts under the **#incomplete** header.
