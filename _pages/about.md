Hello - 

I'm a Product Manager with a technical & design background focusing building platforms & products for customers.

The verticals I am most familiar with are e-commerce, developer/data science/analytics platforms, payment systems, emerging markets & alternative banks.  

My primary focus is the intersection of deep Learning, product development & monetization strategies.

Currently I work at [@Dessa](www.dessa.com) - a Deep Learning startup behind [this wild Joe Rogan DeepFake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWK_iYBl8cA) amongst other Machine Learning projects. As of 2020, we have been acquired by Square - where we use applied deep learning to help build products for our customers. 

Prior to Dessa, I spent a few years building data platforms [@Shopify](www.shopify.com).
